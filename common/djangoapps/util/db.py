    """
    A variant of Django's atomic() which cannot be nested inside another atomic.

    With the upgrade to Django 1.8, all views by default are wrapped
    in an atomic block. Because of this, a commit to the database can
    only happen once the view returns. This is because nested atomic
    blocks use savepoints and the transaction only gets committed when
    the outermost atomic block returns. See the official Django docs
    for details: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/transactions/

    However, in some cases, we need to be able to commit to the
    database in the middle of a view. The only way to do this
    is to disable automatic transaction management for the view by
    adding @transaction.non_atomic_requests to it and then using
    atomic() inside it in relevant places. To help ensure that queries
    inside a piece of code are committed, you can wrap it in
    outer_atomic(). outer_atomic() will ensure that it is not nested
    inside another atomic block.

    If we need to do this to prevent IntegrityErrors, a named outer_atomic
    should be used. You can create a named outer_atomic by passing a name.
    A named outer_atomic only checks that it is not nested under an atomic
    only if it is nested under enable_named_outer_atomic(name=<name>). This way
    only the view which is causing IntegrityErrors needs to have its
    automatic transaction management disabled and other callers are not
    affected.

    Additionally, some views need to use READ COMMITTED isolation level.
    For this add @transaction.non_atomic_requests and
    @outer_atomic(read_committed=True) decorators on it.

    Arguments:
        using (str): the name of the database.
        read_committed (bool): Whether to use read committed isolation level.
        name (str): the name to give to this outer_atomic instance.

        TransactionManagementError: if already inside an atomic block.
