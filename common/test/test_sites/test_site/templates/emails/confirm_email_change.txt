This is to confirm that you changed the e-mail associated with
Open edX from ${old_email} to ${new_email}. If you
did not make this request, please contact us immediately. Contact
information is listed at:

% if settings.FEATURES['ENABLE_MKTG_SITE']:
    ${marketing_link('CONTACT')}
% else:
    http://${ site }${reverse('contact')}
% endif

We keep a log of old e-mails, so if this request was unintentional, we
can investigate.
