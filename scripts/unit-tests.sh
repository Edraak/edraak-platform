#
#   unit-tests.sh
#
#   Execute Python unit tests for edx-platform.
#
#   This script is typically called from generic-ci-tests.sh, which defines
#   these environment variables:
#
#   `TEST_SUITE` defines which kind of test to run.
#   Possible values are:
#
#       - "lms-unit": Run the LMS Python unit tests
#       - "cms-unit": Run the CMS Python unit tests
#       - "commonlib-unit": Run Python unit tests from the common/lib directory
#
#   `SHARD` is a number indicating which subset of the tests to build.
#
#       For "lms-unit", the tests are put into shard groups
#       using the 'attr' decorator (e.g. "@attr(shard=1)"). Anything with
#       the 'shard=n' attribute will run in the nth shard. If there isn't a
#       shard explicitly assigned, the test will run in the last shard.
#
#   This script is broken out so it can be run by tox and redirect stderr to
#   the specified file before tox gets a chance to redirect it to stdout.
